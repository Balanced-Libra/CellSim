* Added a fourth sparkline in the left panel for food (`#sparkFood`, green).
* Tracked food count in stats: `history.food` alongside blue/purple/red.
* Wired DOM ref `this.$sparkFood` and pushed `fCount = this.foods.length` each sample.
* Drew the food series via `drawSpark(..., 'hsl(140,80%,60%)')`.
